FAQ

Can I change my server's operating system later?
Yes! Via our intuitive VPS control panel, you may re-install your VPS's operating system at any time, and switch distributions if desired.

Can I upgrade my VPS plan later?
Yes, you can upgrade your VPS to the next plan up at a later time. The transition is seamless and would only require a minute of downtime for a reboot, in order for the upgrade to take into effect.

How long do I have to wait for my VPS service to be activated?
RackNerd's KVM VPS packages are instantly activated after you complete your order. You will be able to begin using it right away.

Can I get IPv6 addresses with my KVM VPS?
Yes, RackNerd provides up to 100 free IPv6 addresses upon request in our Los Angeles location (more locations will support IPv6 soon). Please open a support ticket after your order to request this.
